# E-Commerce-Price-Insights-Amazon-vs-eBay

## Overview
This project provides a data-driven competitive pricing analysis of Amazon and eBay using Web Scraping, SQL, and Power BI. By collecting real-time pricing data, structuring it in a database, and visualizing trends, this project enables users to compare product prices and identify cost-effective purchasing options.

## Key Features
Automated Web Scraping: Extracts real-time product prices from Amazon & eBay.

SQL-Based Pricing Analytics: Compares pricing trends and identifies cheaper platforms.

Power BI Visualization: Creates interactive dashboards & heatmaps to highlight price variations.

Competitor Analysis: Evaluates eBay vs. Amazon pricing strategies for similar products.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Helps consumers & businesses optimize their buying strategy.

## Project Objectives
Automate data extraction from Amazon & eBay using Python (BeautifulSoup).

Store structured pricing data in MySQL for analysis.

Develop SQL queries to compare Amazon vs. eBay prices & highlight differences.

Visualize price variations using Power BI heatmaps, bar charts, and filters.

Identify the best-priced platform for specific products.

## Project Workflow

### Web Scraping

Extracted product details (Title, Price, URL) from Amazon & eBay.

Used BeautifulSoup for parsing and Pandas for data cleaning.

Stored the cleaned dataset for further analysis.

### SQL Data Processing

Stored data in MySQL for structured querying.

Wrote SQL queries to:

Compare Amazon vs. eBay prices.

Find products that are cheaper on eBay.

Generate price variation insights.

### Power BI Visualization

Created an interactive dashboard with:

Heatmap to show price variations across platforms.

Bar Charts & Tables to compare Amazon and eBay prices.

## Insights & Findings

Identified products that are cheaper on eBay compared to Amazon.

Highlighted price trends & variations using a heatmap.

Generated SQL-based competitor analytics for pricing insights.

## Technologies Used

Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas) -->	Web Scraping & Data Cleaning

MySQL -->	Data Storage & Querying

Power BI --> Data Visualization

## Future Improvements

Automate web scraping to track price changes over time.

Add more competitor platforms (Walmart, Flipkart, etc.).

Deploy as an interactive web app for live price comparisons.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how web scraping, SQL, and Power BI can be integrated to perform a real-world e-commerce pricing analysis. By extracting and analyzing product prices, we gain valuable insights into pricing strategies used by Amazon and eBay. The interactive Power BI dashboard makes it easy to compare and identify the best deals.
With future enhancements, this project can be extended into a fully automated competitor price tracking system.
